        <p class="display-4">Matemasie is an ultra-bold display typeface characterized by rounded edges and a distinctive feature where the shapes widen towards the top. It draws inspiration from the Adinkra symbol "Mate Masie," meaning "what I hear, I keep." This symbolizes interconnected ears, emphasizing the importance of listening and communication in oral traditions and cultures. Additionally, Mate Masie embodies principles of wisdom and prudence.</p>

        <p class="display-4">Matemasie Font is part of Google Fonts' African Latin Font project. The goal of the project is to expand Latin font options for African languages.
Launched in 2020 by Dave Crossland, Google Fonts Lead User Experience Programs and Operations Manager, this laudable project stems from an alarming observation: African languages are underrepresented in digital communications because there are few open source Pan-African fonts that contain all of the letters and diacritics (or accent) marks that are essential for accurate spelling of African languages.

    <div class="container mt-5">
    <div class="col">
          
        <p class="display-4">This gap not only hinders effective communication, but also perpetuates marginalization and cultural erasure. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the need for diverse and culturally representative fonts becomes increasingly important.
It was the desire to address this need and improve the experience of Sub-Saharan African users that led Dave Crossland to contact Denis Moyogo Jacquerye.

        <p class="display-4">The work of Denis Moyogo Jacquerye as linguistic consultant and Laura Meseguer as type designer commissioned  byGoogle Fonts to extend the Questrial font to include all the letterforms of African languages using the Latin script, By including a newly defined "African Latin" glyph set, was particularly appreciated by Google Fonts,
This continued the mission to increase the presence of digital content in African languages.

        <p class="display-4">It was in this context that I was contacted by Thomas Phinney, a type designer and font geek who has been working with fonts since the late 90s, and a contractor for Google Fonts. Who is helping Google create a set of Open source display fonts.
He asked me if I would be interested in helping design one of the typefaces for this project. It was a great honor and a unique opportunity for me to contribute to this endeavor.
Creating an African Latin font for Google Fonts is a perfect fit for my research interests. As a graphic and type designer with a Ph.D. in art and design, my focus is on art and design, typography, African languages and scripts, culture, and innovation. In my articles, I explore how African scripts and other symbols can serve as inspiration for designers and artists. My goal is to amplify the voices of African people and celebrate their culturally rich heritage. I strongly believe that incorporating African scripts and traditional symbols into modern design has the potential to enhance African cultural identity and promote greater cultural diversity.

        <p class="display-4">In this context, Matemasie Font was born as a project to create an African Latin typeface that celebrates the richness of African heritage while meeting contemporary design standards.
When I'm asked to create a typeface inspired by Africa's rich heritage, I know where to look for inspiration. I draw on this rich heritage by connecting to graphic symbols, particularly the Adinkra symbol. 
Adinkra symbols express various themes related to the history, beliefs, and philosophy of the Asante people. They mainly have a proverbial meaning, as proverbs play an important role in Asante culture. The use of proverbs is considered a sign of wisdom. Other Adinkra symbols describe historical events, human behavior and attitudes, animal behavior, the forms of plant life, and the shapes of objects.

        <p class="display-4">Matemasie has a rich and exciting history, a journey of encounters. I've had the opportunity to work with teams and people from different backgrounds, a rewarding collaboration in terms of learning and knowledge. Matemasie has been an extraordinary learning opportunity for me and has allowed me to fully embrace this profession of typeface design, with mentors such as David C, Thomas Phinney, Willis Nathan Lisa Huang, Thomas Hullo-Marchant, and many others who have helped me progress in this project.
The story of Matemasie is a journey to create a typeface that resonates with the spirit of Africa and draws inspiration from its African roots. I poured my soul into every curve and line of Matemasie.
This story was not just about creating letters, but about connecting worlds, linking past and present, and preserving the essence of African heritage for future generations. Matemasie celebrates the harmony between tradition and innovation, reflecting the balance of "Mate Masie".
As such, the Matemasie typeface is not simply a collection of letters; it is a testament to the rich mosaic of African culture and tradition.
At the heart of Matemasie is its inspiration: the Adinkra symbol "Mate Masie". Meaning "what I hear, I keep," this symbol encapsulates the essence of communication, wisdom and connection. Matemasie captures the artistic and spiritual essence of "Mate Masie" through its unique typographic features. Like the symbol from which it is inspired, Matemasie will whisper stories of ancient wisdom and caution to all who contemplate its elegant curves.
It is my hope that the Matemasie story will continue to unfold and evolve with a variety of styles, from the lightest to the boldest, and inspiring typographers to explore the infinite depths of African culture and wisdom.
